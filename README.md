# Europython 2023 Taipy Demo

Taipy is a Python library to build interactive dashboards.

## What is this demo?

This small Taipy application showcases Taipy's native scenarios feature. We
make use of that feature to stack several scenarios on the same plot.

Taipy is the only known application builder with which you can build such a
dashboard. Otherwise you need to hack the tool.

## How to run the application?

```
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Why is the code left uncommented?

Well, I got lazy.

While the application is small and simple, it uses some advanced concepts of Taipy. It would be hard to understand just by reading additional comments anyway.

If you are really intersted in understanding how this demo works, I believe more in a one-to-one explanation.
